Predictive Modeling via RandomForests


One of the industries that demands a well-prepared perspective based on scientific data collected daily from the industry, especially from patients, is health care. In this industry, predicting is a key aspect of data analysis. The average length of stay in hospitals (ALOS) is frequently used as a performance metric. If all other factors remain the same, a shorter stay will lower the cost per discharge and move care from inpatient to less expensive post-acute care (“Length of Hospital Stay,” 2017). Predicting the length of stay (LOS) of patients based on their vitals and diagnosis and also other metrics provides an understanding of what metrics have a bigger impact on the LOS.
